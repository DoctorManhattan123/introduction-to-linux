# Number Systems and Character Encodings

Welcome to the first chapter of our journey into the world of Linux.

In this chapter, we'll dive into the fundamental concepts of number systems and character
encodings â€” a crucial foundation for everything you will encounter in the world of computers.

We begin by exploring two essential number systems: binary and hexadecimal.
These systems are the backbone of computer operations, with binary (base-2) being the way how
almost every computer represents data nowadays and hexadecimal (base-16)
serving as a more human-friendly way to represent binary data.

Next, you will be introduced to the world of character encodings, starting with Unicode.
We'll also cover ASCII and UTF-8, two widely used character encodings.

This chapter aims to provide you with a clear and concise understanding of these fundamental concepts,
setting the stage for the more advanced topics that follow in the book.
